                    <h2>HTML</h2>
                    <p>
                        HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language. "Markup language" means that,
                        rather than using a programming language to perform functions,
                        HTML uses tags to identify different types of content and the purposes they each serve to the
                        webpage.
                        Using HTML, you can add headings, format paragraphs, control line breaks, make lists, emphasize
                        text,
                        create special characters, insert images, create links, build tables, control some styling, and
                        much more.

                    <h2>CSS</h2>
                    <p>
                        CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets. This programming language dictates how the HTML elements
                        of a website
                        should actually appear on the frontend of the page.CSS was invented and released in 1996: All
                        formatting could be removed from
                        HTML documents and stored in separate CSS (.css) files.
                        So, what exactly does CSS stand for? It stands for Cascading Style Sheets -- and "style sheet"
                        refers to the document itself.
                        Ever web browser has a default style sheet, so every web page out there is affected by at least
                        one style sheet -- the default
                        style sheet of whatever browser the web page visitor is using -- regardless whether or not the
                        web designer applies any styles.

                    <h2>JavaScript</h2>
                    <p>
                        JavaScript is a logic-based programming language that can be used to modify website content and
                        make it behave in different ways in response to a user's actions.
                        Common uses for JavaScript include confirmation boxes, calls-to-action, and adding new
                        identities to existing information.
                        In short, JavaScript is a programming language that lets web developers design interactive
                        sites. Most of the dynamic behavior you'll see on a web page is thanks to JavaScript, which
                        augments a browser's default controls and behaviors.
